					    Positive Psychology is a new field of research that focuses on making the normal person happier.
					  </p>
						<p>
							As long as psychology has been around, its focus has been on getting sick people back to normal. The belief was that if you can rid a person of negative emotion, they will be happy. Recent research has determined that this is simply untrue.
						</p>
						<p>
							Imagine your brain was a knee. If it was broken, your goal would be to get it back to normal; you would get surgery if necessary, see a doctor to get medicine, and visit a physical therapist to rehabiliate. But now we know that being normal isn't good enough -- you have to make it stronger to be healthy and the only way to make it stronger is through training.

					    Happiness is a skill.

						<p>
							And like any other skill, some people are naturally talented but more importantly, it can be taught, learned, and improved. The research conducted by <a href="http://psych.ucr.edu/faculty/lyubomirsky/">Dr. Sonja Lybomirsky</a> has shown our total happiness is made up of three parts.

					    Happiness from circumstances is not only a small part, but it's habitual.
					  </p>
						<p>
							One of the good parts of our brains is our ability to adapt. When a traumatizing event occurs, it affects us negatively, some times for a long period of time, but then we adapt and go back to our normal lives and our happiness set point mentioned above.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
						  <p>
						  	The truth is, bad things don't affect us as profoundly as we expect them to. That's true of good things, too. We adapt very quickly to either.

							When someone gets a new promotion, car, house, clothes, etc., they feel excited, proud, happy -- however these are all things proven to fall under the psychological phenomenon called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill">Hedonic Treadmill</a>. Let's say you currently drive a BMW 300 series. One day you decide to buy a new BMW M3; you're super excited and happy. But six months from now, it will be your new standard of living and you'll be eyeing up the next model up, thinking it will make happier. This adaptation is the Hedonic Treadmill (also known as Hedonic Adaptation) in action.
